# MachineLearningProject1_BreastCancerClassification
This is my first Machine Learning Project on Github. This project uses data from the Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database which is already pre-processed. 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

The project uses Machine learning technique to classify datapoints to Malignant or Benign types of cancer. The technique used in this project is Support Vector Machine(SVM). It identified the tumors with 97% accuracy. 
The technique can be improved by using Computer vision to directly classify the tissue images.
